  Spelling mistake registration section >> Accompanying person instead of "Accompaning"
  under Registration Fee waiver scheme : the heading is repeated twice in the text as well..keep it only heading and start with "select number of registration fee..." 
  
  National Advisory Committee >>> correct the numbering after 11 and add a name of Prof. U.C. Gupta, IIT Kharagpur
  
  Home>> mark registration section as "new". Put an reflecting icon of "Registration Fee waiver scheme for students/ research scholars" at Home somewhere same as last date of Abstract.
